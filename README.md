+ It has been verified with a real account and has not been blocked for 5 days
# Instructions for use

- Choose to show the target tab
- click the open button
ps:
+ You can check whether the captured image is complete in the collection interface. The upper layer is the collected image, and the lower layer is the comparison result of the features. If it is a black screen, it has not been opened with administrator privileges.
+ The mismatch between the mark point and the actual position can be adjusted by the value on the calibration page
